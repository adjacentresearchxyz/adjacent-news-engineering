# Adjacent News Engineering 

You can read some of our [engineering posts here](/posts) or read a little more about us below

We are building a prediction market data platform ([over 35k markets and growing](https://x.com/0xperp/status/1799294808311345517)) alongside a robust [RSS news reader](https://www.notion.so/Adjacent-News-One-Pager-0bfbded391c146059029edc9bb3f656c?pvs=21). 

Prediction markets struggle for a few reasons 

- **Discovery**
- Oracles / Settlement Criteria
- Long Bets
- Liquidity

But are very beneficial for forward looking news, they successfully beat or were the first to predict

- [Fed Rates](https://blakelaw.dev/portfolio/predicting-the-fed/)
- [COVID-19](https://pandemic.metaculus.com)
- and of course [elections](https://polymarket.com/elections)

We are solving the discovery problem by highlighting forward looking markets alongside current news.
